# AwesomeAPI

AwesomeAPI is simply a collection of simple tasks that I found mysqlf using frequently, such as showing the IP address of the client or generating QR codes.

AwesomeAPI uses Sinatra, as it makes writing APIs extremely simple. The index shows a command listing of implemented functions.

This project is still in its infancy and will have features added very frequently. All pull requests are welcome and encouraged.
